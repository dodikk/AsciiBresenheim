This is an implementation of the classical lines plotting algorithm targeted to the ASCII art.
It uses only standard C++ libraries. The only third-partt dependence is cppunit, used for unit testing.

The project has been developed with MS VisualStudio 2008. However, it should compile for gcc as well (I have not checked it yet).
